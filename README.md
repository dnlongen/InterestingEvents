# InterestingEvents
Windows events of interest for logging and detection of compromise. Work in progress.

| Event ID | Log | Source | Task Category | Notes |
| -------- | --- | ------ | ------------- | ----- |
| 1102 | SECURITY | Eventlog | Log clear | The audit log (aka SYSTEM log) was cleared. This may indicate an intruder covering their tracks; the event message will specify the domain name and account name. Note that clearing logs other than the audit log will generate an Event ID 104 in the SYSTEM log instead. |
| 4720 | SECURITY | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing |	User Account Management | A user account was created. High confidence on workstations and member servers. Noisy on domain controllers and needs to correlate against expected changes. SubjectDomainName and SubjectAccountName are the privileged user that made the change; TargetDomainName and TargetUserName are the new user |
| 4722 | SECURITY | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing |	User Account Management | A user account was enabled. High confidence on workstations and member servers. Noisy on domain controllers and needs to correlate against expected changes. If terminated employee accounts are disabled rather than deleted, re-enablement outside of an established process is a high confidence indicator. |
| 4726 | SECURITY | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing |	User Account Management | A user account was deleted. Could indicate an intruder covering their tracks. |
| 4697 | SECURITY | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | Security System Extension | A service was installed in the system. Potentially noisy on workstations and member servers, but a service unexpectedly installed could also indicate a persistence mechanism. |
| 4698 | SECURITY | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | Other Object Access Events | A scheduled task was created. Potentially noisy on workstations and member servers, but an unexpected scheduled task could also indicate a persistence mechanism. 4698 events contain details about the newly-created scheduled task in the Task Information field. **4698 events are only created if Object Access --> Other Object Access Events is enabled. Without that audit item, you are left with less informative Event ID 106 (Task registered) in the microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational log** |
| 4672 | SECURITY | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | Special Logon | Special privileges assigned to new logon. Indicates an administrator account logged on. Best practice is to restrict admin privileges to admin accounts that are separate from daily-use accounts; 4672 events where TargetDomainName and TargtAccountName are other than an expected administrator account can indicate inappropriate access. |
| 4624 | SECURITY | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | Logon | An account was successfully logged on. Noisy, but very useful in specific scenarios. In a domain environment, the local Administrator account should never be used except to initially build a system or to troubleshoot domain membership issues. For local accounts, TargetDomainName will be the machine account and will end in $. After tuning any expected use of local accounts, any 4624 event where TargetDomainName ends in $ is a high-confidence indicator. |
| 4688 | SECURITY | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | Process Creation | A new process has been created. This is a very noisy indicator. Interesting scenarios to look for include 4688 events where ParentProcessName is WinWord.EXE, Excel.EXE, PowerPnt.EXE, AcroRd32.exe, or other applications one would not expect to execute additional programs. See https://www.securityforrealpeople.com/2017/10/exploiting-office-native-functionality.html for an example of this technique detecting malice. **4688 events are only created if Detailed Tracking --> Process Creation auditing is enabled.**|
| 104 | SYSTEM | Eventlog | Log clear | A Windows event log was cleared. The log message will identify the specific log. |
